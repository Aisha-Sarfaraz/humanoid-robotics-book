# Safety Protocols (Additional Details)

## Lab Access Control

**Simulation Labs**: Accessible during building hours with student ID. No special training required.

**Physical Robot Labs**: Restricted access requiring:
1. Completion of safety training (documented with signed form)
2. Passing safety quiz (80% minimum score)
3. Instructor supervision for first 3 sessions
4. Buddy system (minimum 2 people present) for all robot operations

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Standards

**Simulation Labs**: None required. Ergonomic guidelines:
- Monitor at arm's length, top of screen at eye level
- Feet flat on floor or footrest
- 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds

**Physical Robot Labs**:
- Closed-toe shoes (MANDATORY - no sandals, flip-flops, or open-toed footwear)
- Safety glasses (MANDATORY when robots operational)
- Long pants recommended (no shorts near moving parts)
- Tie back long hair
- Remove dangling jewelry, lanyards

## Insurance and Liability

Universities should verify that:
- General liability insurance covers robotics activities
- Students sign liability waivers before physical robot access
- Lab supervisors maintain current CPR/First Aid certification
- All incidents reported to Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) within 24 hours
