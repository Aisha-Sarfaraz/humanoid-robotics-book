# Chapter 2: Applications of Physical AI

## 2.1 Current State of Humanoid Robotics

The commercial deployment of humanoid robots and Physical AI systems has accelerated dramatically in the past five years, transitioning from research prototypes to production-scale implementations across healthcare, manufacturing, and service industries. Understanding these application domains is essential for educators designing curricula: students must see clear career pathways and tangible impact to justify the investment in learning complex robotics systems.

This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of three primary application domains, supported by deployment statistics, market data, and peer-reviewed research. Each domain demonstrates not only technical feasibility but also measurable economic impact, validating the importance of Physical AI education for future engineering workforces.
