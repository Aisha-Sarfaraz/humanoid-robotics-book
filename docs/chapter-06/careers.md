# Career Development Resources

## Skill Development Roadmap

To maximize job readiness, students should develop:

**Technical Skills**:
- Programming: Python (required), C++ (highly valued)
- Frameworks: ROS 2, PyTorch/TensorFlow, OpenCV
- Tools: Git, Docker, Linux command line
- Mathematics: Linear algebra, probability, optimization

**Domain Knowledge**:
- Control theory, computer vision, motion planning
- Hardware: sensors, actuators, embedded systems
- Safety standards, testing methodologies

**Soft Skills**:
- Technical writing (documentation, papers)
- Collaboration (robotics is team sport)
- Communication (explaining complex systems to non-experts)

## Professional Development

**Conferences to Attend**:
- ICRA (IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation)
- IROS (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)
- CoRL (Conference on Robot Learning)
- RSS (Robotics: Science and Systems)

**Online Communities**:
- ROS Discourse: https://discourse.ros.org
- /r/robotics subreddit
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim forums

**Continuing Education**:
- Online courses: Coursera, edX robotics specializations
- Certifications: NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute
- Graduate education: MS/PhD programs for advanced roles

## Job Search Strategy

**Portfolio Development**: Maintain GitHub with well-documented projects demonstrating:
- ROS 2 proficiency
- Computer vision applications
- Autonomous navigation systems
- Integration projects (capstone-quality work)

**Networking**: Attend conferences, join professional societies (IEEE Robotics and Automation Society), connect on LinkedIn.

**Interview Preparation**: Expect technical screens (coding, algorithms), system design questions (architecture a warehouse robot fleet), and behavioral interviews (teamwork, problem-solving).
