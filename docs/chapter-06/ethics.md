# Ethics and Responsible AI (Expanded)

## Safety-Critical Systems

Physical robots can cause injury, making safety paramount. Unlike software bugs that cause crashes, robotics failures can injure humans. This demands:

**Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs that systems satisfy safety properties. Challenge: neural network components resist formal analysis.

**Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Hardware E-stops, software watchdogs, force-limiting actuators prevent catastrophic failures.

**Testing Regimes**: Extensive simulation + staged real-world deployment (controlled environments before public spaces).

## Bias in Robotic Perception

Computer vision systems train on datasets (ImageNet, COCO) that may under-represent certain demographics. Result: Face detection works worse for darker skin tones, hand gesture recognition fails for users with disabilities.

**Mitigation**: Audit training datasets for demographic balance, evaluate model performance across demographic groups, collect additional data for under-represented groups.

## Labor and Economic Impact

Automation displaces some jobs while creating others. Responsible AI education includes economic impact analysis, not just technical optimization. Students should understand:

- Which jobs are vulnerable to automation
- How to design human-robot collaboration (augmentation, not replacement)
- Policy implications of technological unemployment
