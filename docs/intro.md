# Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## A Resource-Aware Pedagogical Framework

### Abstract

This book addresses a critical gap in computer science education: how to teach Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics in resource-constrained academic environments. Traditional robotics education requires expensive hardware, specialized facilities, and substantial budgets - barriers that prevent most institutions from offering comprehensive courses in this rapidly growing field.

We present a **simulation-first pedagogical framework** that enables universities to launch complete Physical AI courses using primarily virtual environments, making this essential technology accessible regardless of budget constraints. The framework includes a detailed 13-week curriculum, three budget tiers ($5K, $15K, $50K+), safety protocols, and evidence-based teaching strategies.

**Target Audience**: University instructors (computer science background), graduate students exploring research directions, and industry trainers designing intensive programs.

**Key Contributions**:
- Complete 13-week curriculum framework with four modules (ROS 2, Physics Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action)
- Three hardware infrastructure tiers accommodating budgets from $5,000 to $50,000+
- Evidence-based pedagogical strategies supported by peer-reviewed research
- Practical safety protocols and lab exercise templates
- Career pathways and research frontiers in Physical AI

### How to Use This Book

**For Instructors**: Start with Chapters 1-5 to design your course syllabus, select your hardware tier, and adapt the curriculum framework to your institution's needs.

**For Graduate Students**: Focus on Chapters 2, 3, and 6 to understand application domains, pedagogical foundations, and research frontiers for thesis topic selection.

**For Industry Trainers**: Review Chapters 4, 5, and 7 plus the Appendices to adapt the framework to accelerated 2-4 week intensive formats.
