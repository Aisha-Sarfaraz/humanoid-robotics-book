## Prompt

Book Constitution: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course
Project Identity
Project Name: Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course
Platform: Docusaurus + Spec-Kit Plus
Deployment: GitHub Pages
Primary Tools: Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
Target Audience: Computer science students and academics
Knowledge Level: Advanced undergraduate/graduate level

Core Principles
1. Academic Integrity
   - Primary Source Verification: Every factual claim must be traceable to authoritative, verifiable sources
   - Zero Plagiarism Tolerance: All content must pass plagiarism detection with 0% similarity
   - Intellectual Honesty: Proper attribution for all ideas, concepts, and data
   - Peer Review Standards: Prioritize peer-reviewed academic publications

2. Educational Excellence
   - Clarity First: Content must be accessible to readers with computer science backgrounds
   - Pedagogical Structure: Logical progression from foundational to advanced concepts
   - Practical Application: Balance theory with hands-on, reproducible examples
   - Engagement: Maintain academic rigor while keeping content compelling

3. Reproducibility
   - Citation Traceability: Every claim must include proper citation enabling readers to verify sources
   - Code Examples: All technical implementations must be testable and reproducible
   - Data Transparency: Datasets, algorithms, and methodologies clearly documented
   - Version Control: All changes tracked through Git with meaningful commit messages

4. Technical Rigor
   - Accuracy: Technical details verified against multiple authoritative sources
   - Currency: Focus on current state-of-the-art while acknowledging historical context
   - Depth: Sufficient technical detail for implementation and understanding
   - Scope Management: Comprehensive coverage within defined boundaries

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive project constitution v1.0.0 for "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course" with complete governance framework covering:

1. Four core principles: Academic Integrity, Educational Excellence, Reproducibility, Technical Rigor
2. Content standards with APA citation requirements and writing quality guidelines
3. Technical specifications for Docusaurus-based documentation
4. Four-phase development workflow (Planning, Writing, Review & Refinement, Deployment)
5. Comprehensive quality assurance checklist with measurable acceptance criteria
6. Clear prohibited practices and source evaluation criteria
7. Success metrics (quantitative and qualitative)
8. Tool-specific guidelines for Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus, and GitHub
9. Governance framework with amendment process and compliance requirements

All placeholders filled, no unresolved tokens. Sync impact report included showing template compatibility confirmed across plan-template.md, spec-template.md, and tasks-template.md.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution v1.0.0 ratified establishing complete governance framework for academic documentation project
- 🧪 Tests: Template validation, placeholder completion, dependent template consistency review
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (created with 455 lines, sync impact report included)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with Docusaurus integration setup, initialize project structure per constitution requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully tailored for academic publishing workflow with Docusaurus. All four core principles operationalized with measurable requirements. Ready for content development phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution creation successful on first attempt
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All placeholders filled, no unresolved tokens, template compatibility verified
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Standard constitution establishment workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None required - constitution complete and ready for use
